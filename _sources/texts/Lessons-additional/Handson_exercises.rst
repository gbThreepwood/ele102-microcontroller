Here are lots of exercises.

A Common Circuit for Almost All of the Exercises
=====================================================

To make your (and our) life a little bit simpler, we have prepared a common circuit which will be applicable to a multitude of exercises. Not all of the circuit is required in all of the exercises, the idea is that you should have everything ready no matter what the specific excercise needs, hopefully leading to faster completion of the exercises. I suppose this approach is a double-edged sword though, as practicing the wiring is also a very valuable exercise. If you feel that you have trouble understanding the wiring, we recommend that you re-wire your circuit for each exercise, in order to get the required practice.
