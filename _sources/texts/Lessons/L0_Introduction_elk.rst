Course introduction
*********************

.. It might be nice for us (teachers) to have a glance like an abstract, the aim or this lesson, expected outcomes in the beginning of every page :)

.. Since our classes has a slightly different schedule, I have created a separate introduction page for the "elkraft" students (Eirik, 07.01.2022).

    **Aim:**

    Students should have some idea of what kind of a semester waits for them.

    **Materials:**

    None

    **Code:**

    None

**Total course duration:** 17 weeks

In total 7 assignment. There is no explicit lab. assignments, but the obligatory work includes practical work on the Arduino kit. All the components you need should be available in the kit, and thus you do not need to be in the lab. to do the practical work. You can complete everything at your own pace in the comfort of your home.

All obligatory homeworks will be published in Canvas, and have 1-2 week of duration. Asking about the assignments are highly encouraged.

Furthermore the teaching schedule, and any important notifications will be published on Canvas. This webpage exists solely for the purpose of presenting you with the required curriculum for each week.

Exercises that we work on in the classes are *not* necessarily supposed to be finished in the class. You are not in highschool anymore. Freedom is yours as long as you use it wisely and not abuse it. Even if they are not mandatory we recommend you to finish any exercise we have started on before next weeks lesson starts.

Arduino is just a tool for this course. The aim is not *how to program Arduino*. The aim is to understand microcontrollers, and computer architecture *using Arduino*.

Collaboration is highly encouraged in this course. If you want to get into more fun part, you need to collaborate. Helping each other is not cheating. *But* copy-paste of codes from somewhere or someone is cheating, and has almost zero value when it comes to obtaining an understanding for the topics. I believe you are qualified enough to distinguish these two.
