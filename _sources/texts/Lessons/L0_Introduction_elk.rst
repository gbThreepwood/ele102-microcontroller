Course introduction

.. It might be nice for us (teachers) to have a glance like an abstract, the aim or this lesson, expected outcomes in the beginning of every page :)

.. Since our classes has a slightly different schedule, I have created a separate introduction page for the "elkraft" students (Eirik, 07.01.2022).

..
    .. note:: *13/01/2021*

    **Aim:**

    Students should have some idea of what kind of a semester waits for them.

    **Materials:**

    None

    **Code:**

    None

You can find a overview of what you will learn in the `Course Curriculum <https://www.hvl.no/studier/studieprogram/emne/ELE102>`_.

.. **Total course duration:** 17 weeks

In total there will be 7 assignments. There is no explicit lab. assignment, but the obligatory work includes practical work on the Arduino kit. All the components you need should be available in the kit, and thus you do not need to be in the lab. to do the practical work. You can complete everything at your own pace in the comfort of your home.

All obligatory homeworks will be published in Canvas, and have 1-2 week of deadline. Asking about the assignments are highly encouraged.

Furthermore the teaching schedule, and any important notifications will be published on Canvas. This webpage exists solely for the purpose of presenting you with the required curriculum for each week.

Exercises that we work on in the classes are *not* necessarily supposed to be finished in the class. You are not in highschool anymore. Freedom is yours as long as you use it wisely and not abuse it. Even if they are not mandatory, we recommend you to finish any exercise we have started on before next weeks lesson starts.

Arduino is just a tool for this course. The aim is not *how to program Arduino*. The aim is to understand microcontrollers, and computer architecture *using Arduino*.

Collaboration is highly encouraged in this course. Helping each other is not cheating. *But* copy-paste of codes from somewhere or someone is cheating, and has almost zero value when it comes to obtaining an understanding for the topics. I believe you are qualified enough to distinguish these two. Websites such as `https://stackoverflow.com/ <https://stackoverflow.com/>`_ have long been a source from where studenst copy code which they do not understand. More recently tools such as ChatGPT has been added to the list of tools which allow you to (occationally) get something to work without understanding it. We highly recommend you to put down the required effort to understand what you are doing. You are expected to complete the exam on your own, no such tools will be available on the exam.

The programming languages which we use to tell the computer what we want it to do are (unlike human languages) created using wery consistent and rigorous rules. It is essential that you understand the fundamental rules of the language (they are few and simple), only then can you expect to be able to understand and write complex code. The language is just a tool to express your ideas, and simple enough once fully grasped. The hard part is beeing able to design 

We hope you will enjoy this course, and find microcontroller software development just as fun and rewarding as we do.
