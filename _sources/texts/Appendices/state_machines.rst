State machines and how to implement them on microcontrollers
************************************************************

In order to systematically design and implement the intended behaviour of a embedded system, it is often useful to think in terms of state machines. This will help us to break down complex problems into simpler parts. Another benefit is that it often simplifies the design of software that solves multiple tasks simultaneously.


Mealy and Moore machines
========================

State machines can be divided into two major categories Mealy and Moore, named after their inventors. In a Mealy state machine the output is dependend on the current state, as well as the inputs. In a Moore state machine the output depends only on the current state.


Hierarchical state machine
==========================
A common issue with traditional state machines is that similar (but not exactly equal) states causes the need for repeating the same behaviour in many states. This is known as the "state-explosion‚Äù phenomenon.

In order to overcome this issue the hierarchical state machines has been introduced as a way of capturing the common behaviour of different states. In a hierarchical state machine, a given state may exist as a substate of a more generic superstate. Any event not handled by the substate will automatically be passed on to the superstate. Thus the substate only implements the difference from the superstate. This is known as behavioural inheritance.

.. warning::
        Rewrite this code to Arduino specific examples, and use external LED's, switches and similar to visualize the operation.

Simple switch case based implementation

            switch(state)
            {

                switch(event)
                {

Function pointer based implementation

.. code-block:: c

        #include <stdio.h>

        struct state;
        typedef void state_fn(struct state *);

        struct state
        {
            state_fn * next;
            int i; // data
        };
        
        state_fn foo, bar;
        
        void foo(struct state * state)
        {
            printf("%s %i\n", __func__, ++state->i);
            state->next = bar;
        }
        
        void bar(struct state * state)
        {
            printf("%s %i\n", __func__, ++state->i);
            state->next = state->i < 10 ? foo : 0;
        }
        
        int main(void)
        {
            struct state state = { foo, 0 };
            while(state.next) state.next(&state);
        }

A traffic light control system is a classical example of a problem that could be solved using a state machine.
