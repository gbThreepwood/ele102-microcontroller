.. _about_the_notes:

These lecture notes are prepared by Gizem Ate≈ü and Eirik Haustveit for use in the course "ELE102 Programmering og mikrokontrollere" which is a course in embedded systems, and microcontroller programming offered at the Western Norway University of Applied Sciences. Although they are prepared for a specific course, they are also published in the wild, in the hope that they might be useful for people outside the specific course.

We appreciate constructive feedback, and hope to be able to correct any mistake which is reported. To avoid spam we do not publish any email address here, but you may use the issue tracker in github (on which this site is resting) in order to reach us.
