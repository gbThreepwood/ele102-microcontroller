Synchroscope (synchronoscope)
*****************************

A synchroscope is used to determine the phase relation between two AC power supplies. Usually in order to determine if it is safe to connect the power supplies. E.g. after a generator in a hydro power plant is started and it has come up to a speed in which it is producing approximately 50 Hz AC voltage, the sinusoidal waveform will likely not be in phase with the rest of the power grid to which is should be connected. If the frequencies does not match perfectly (it is highly unlikely that it will) the phase relation will continuously change, and the two AC networks can be safely connected when the phase difference is small enough.

Theory
======

Consider the following two equations for the voltage generated by two independent generators:

.. math::

    v_{G1}(t) = \hat{V}_{G1} \sin(\omega_{G1} t + \Phi_{G1})

.. math::

    v_{G2}(t) = \hat{V}_{G1} \sin(\omega_{G2} t + \Phi_{G2})

For safe interconnection, the two functions must have the same value (the voltage must me equal, i.e. there must be no voltage difference):

.. math::

    \hat{V}_{G1} \sin(\omega_{G1} t + \Phi_{G1}) = \hat{V}_{G1} \sin(\omega_{G2} t + \Phi_{G2})

The four criteria for interconnection of two three phase AC power networks are:

* Equal voltage (:math:`\hat{V}_{G1} = \hat{V}_{G2}`)
* Equal frequency (:math:`\omega_{G1} = \omega_{G2}`)
* Equal phase sequence (connected correctly)
* Equal phase (overlapping of the sine waves in each phase, i.e. :math:`\Phi_{G1} = \Phi_{G2}`)

Hardware and software implementation
====================================

For the software implementation a singe project supporting multiple methods has been developed.

Methods to determine voltage, frequency and  phase relation
-----------------------------------------------------------

There are many possibilities for determination of the phase relation between two sine waves, some of which include:

* Zero cross detection
* Measurement of the voltage difference
* Single frequency DFT
* Full DFT (FFT), with some algorithm for determining the fundamental component
* Phase locked loop (PLL)
* Least squares phasor estimation

Not all methods are suitable for synchronization of AC power grid waveforms. The method must be able to cope with waveforms of slightly different frequencies, and it must be able to handle noise.

Zero crossing based synchroscope

PLL based synchroscope

Least squares based synchroscope
--------------------------------

The least squares method is a popular method for phasor estimation. Since the phasor contains the information we need (voltage magnitude and phase), we can estimate the instantaneous voltage phasor for each of the two generators, and use this information for calculation of the phase difference.

Laboratory experiment
=====================

In order to verify the applicability of the method, a laboratory experiment has been performed using two small synchronous generators.
