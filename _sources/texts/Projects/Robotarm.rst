Remote Controlled Robot Arm
*****************************

There are varions ways. If it is not automatic you need to control. Self-driving cars are completely different concept.


Bluetooth Controlled
=================================

Move robot joints via your mobile phone.


Joystick Controlled
=================================

Move robot joints via joystick.


Mini 3-Dof manipulator
=================================

I will provide the servos for you. Design your own manipulator
